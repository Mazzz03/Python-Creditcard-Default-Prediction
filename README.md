# Python-Creditcard-Default-Prediction
This repository contains my Jupyter notebook and Tableau visualization that I created to predict and visualize creditcard defaults by bank clients. The main aim of this project was to enhance my skills in Python and Tableau. The 'CC decision tree.ipynb' contains my code and thought process for predicting creditcard defaults. The 'Dashboard CC default.pdf' file contains the dashboard that I created in tableau in order to visualize the steps in my decision tree model from left to right. The 'UCI_Credit_Card (3).csv' file contains the dataset that I used for my analysis. The data comes from: https://www.kaggle.com/lucabasa/credit-card-default-a-very-pedagogical-notebook/. In this link you will also find more information on what each feature of my dataset should represent, this might help you in understanding my notebook. I want to thank you for taking the time to review my work, any comments or suggestions for improvement are always appreciated.
